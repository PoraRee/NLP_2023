        "In this exercise, you are going to learn and implement decoding techniques for sequence generation. Usually, the sequence is generated word-by-word from a model. In each step, the model predicted the most likely word based on the predicted words in previous steps (this is called auto-regressive decoding).\n",
        "\n",
        "As such, it is very important how you decide on what to predicted at each step, as it will be conditioned on to predicted all of the following steps. We will implement two of main decoding techniques introduced in the lecture: **Greedy Decoding** and **Beam Search Decoding**. Greedy Decoding immediately chooses the word with best score at each step, while Beam Search Decoding focuses on the sequence that give the best score overall.\n",

        "To complete this exercise, you will need to complete the methods for decoding for a text generation model trained on [New York Times Comments and Headlines dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/aashita/nyt-comments). The model is trained to predict a headline for the news given seed text. You do not need to train any model model in this exercise as we provide both the pretrained model and dictionary.\n"
